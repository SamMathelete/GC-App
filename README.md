## Developer Instructions:

Go to the screens and start adding the content in the Views in the Functional Components directly without disturbing the code outside it. In case of TypeScript Issues, view docs for TypeScript and React-Native. For navigation specific issues, view React Navigation Docs.

## Simulation Guidelines:

As of 20th Dec 2022, the app opens on a login screen with two buttons called student login and admin login. Just click any one it and it will take you to the login screen where you can click the login button to go to home screen from where you can navigate via the tabs.
