Result of a tie, however, can be declared when either of the competing teams wins 3 matches. \n● Each match in a tie would consist of 3 sets of 21 points (along with deuce if any). \n● Players will get 2 minutes break after each set and 1 minute break after any of the players playing the match reaches 11 points. \n● The order of matches in a tie shall be as follows: Men’s Singles Women’s singles Men’s Doubles Mixed Doubles Men’s Singles \n● Any player cannot play more than 1 singles match and 1 doubles match. \n● In case of a draw, the total number of matches won by the teams will be considered to determine the result of the pool. In case of further draw, total number points won by the team will be considered. \n● The final list of names of players in playing order has to be given to the referee 15 minutes prior to each tie. \n● Yonex Mavis - 350/500 Nylon shuttlecocks will be used to conduct badminton matches in the tournament. Each team can issue at most 2 badminton rackets from Gymkhana. 83 \n● 100 Points will be awarded to the teams for each winning match in League Stages, however if the team ends up in 1st, 2nd or 3rd position in the final points table, then these points will not be valid for those top 3 teams. \n● Players are not allowed to play without non-marking badminton shoes (that is, use gum sole shoes). In case a player doesn't have non marking shoes, he/she is allowed to play bare-footed. \n● Any delay in the arrival of the team (or players) in a tie (or match) would lead to walkover for the opponent team (or player). In case of absence of both the playing teams of a tie (or both sides in a match) the tie (or match) would be abandoned. However, in case of inevitable reason, if the team coordinator informs in advance, the final decision lies with the referee. \n● Disturbance from the roof in the middle of a rally will make that rally null and void, hence players will have to play for that point again. \n● Referee’s call will be the final decision. Arguing with the officials will lead to disqualification of the player",

In case the current speaker breaks any of the three cardinal rules, the other three panelists can challenge them. \n4. A panelist scores one point for making a correct challenge against whoever is speaking, or the speaker gets the point if the challenge is deemed incorrect.\n5. If a witty interjection amuses the audience but is not a correct challenge, at the chairman's discretion, the challenger can nevertheless be awarded an extra point (the \"bonus point\" rule).\n6. A player who makes a correct challenge takes over the subject for the remainder of the minute or until successfully challenged.\n7. The person speaking when the whistle blows after 60 seconds also scores a point. \n8. An extra point is awarded if a panelist speaks for the entire minute without being challenged. \n9. Once all four speakers are done, the game will be scored, and the winner of that round will be declared. \n10. Depending upon the number of participants, this competition will have multiple rounds.\nThe judges can also modify the rules on the spot.\n",

    "guidelines": "1. Each branch has to send exactly 4 people for the scrabble tournament.\n2. The players with rank below 8 will be awarded participation points only after they play all the prelims matches.\n3. The total of 32 participants will be distributed in eight groups of four. This distribution will be done via an open draw before the tournament.\n4. Games will be 1v1, with all players playing all rounds of the tournament. \n5. The final results will be based on the cumulative wins over all rounds (Player will get 1 point for every win, 0 for every loss and 0.5 in the case of a bye for each game). \n6. Time limit for each game: 30 (+4 overtime) minutes (15 (+2 overtime) per side). Things like arranging tiles, time for totalling, etc. are not counted in the 15 minutes. \n7. Going over the time limit will automatically award the win to the opponent (Time forfeit). \nUpon entering each minute of overtime, 10 points are deducted from the player’s score.\n8. If the player reaches the end of the second minute of overtime, they lose by time forfeit. \n9. Matches are not void. \n10. You can challenge your opponent’s play. Any play may be challenged before the next player starts a turn. \n11. If the play challenged is unacceptable, the challenged player takes back their tiles and loses that turn. If the play challenged is acceptable, the challenger loses their next turn. Consult the dictionary for challenges only.\n12. All words made in one play are challenged simultaneously. If any word is unacceptable, then the entire play is unacceptable. Only one turn is lost on any challenge.\nWe will be following the official Scrabble rules as detailed in this link: https://scrabble.hasbro.com/en-us/ruled.\n13. All disputes will be settled by the Tournament Director, who will have the final word on disputes. Use of unfair means will lead to immediate disqualification of the participant from that event.
